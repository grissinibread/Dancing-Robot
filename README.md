# 🤖 Dancing Robot
An expressive robot that dances and shows emotion through animated LED facial expressions and motor movements. Built using an STM32 Nucleo board, this robot combines embedded systems programming with creative physical interaction.

# 🧠 Overview
This project aims to bring emotion and motion together in a fun and educational robotics build. The Dancing Robot moves around and uses 8x8 LED matrices to simulate expressive eyes and a mouth, reacting with preprogrammed behaviors like happy, mad, sad, and love.

# 💡 Features
- 🟢 Animated facial expressions using LED matrices
- 🛞 Responsive wheeled motion via motor control
- 🔌 Serial and SPI communication
- 🛠️ Fully soldered and assembled hardware prototype
- 🎭 Emotion-based behaviors programmed in C
